    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Rinse basmati rice 2–3 times and soak in water for 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>In a bowl, mix your meat or vegetables with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, salt, and a little garam masala.</li>

        <li>Let the meat marinate for at least 30 minutes (longer is better for meat)</li>

        <li>In a large pot, heat oil or ghee and fry sliced onions until golden brown. Set aside half for layering later.</li>

        <li>In the same pot, add marinated meat/veggies and cook until tender. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until soft. Add green chilies and more spices if needed. Add some mint and coriander leaves for flavor.</li>

        <li>In a separate pot, boil water with salt and a few whole spices (like bay leaves, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves).</li>

        <li>Add soaked rice and cook until 70–80% done. Drain the rice.</li>

        <li>In a large pot, layer the cooked meat/vegetables and partially cooked rice alternately.</li>

        <li>Top with fried onions, mint/coriander, and saffron milk or food color for aroma and color.</li>

        <li>Cover the pot tightly with a lid. Cook on low heat for 15–20 minutes to let the flavors blend (you can place the pot on a tawa/pan to avoid direct heat).</li>

        <li>Gently mix the layers before serving. Enjoy your biryani with raita or salad!</li>
